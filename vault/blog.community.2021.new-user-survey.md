The new user survey was open for several months in 2021, where we were prompting new Dendron users within VS Code itself. We had a few thousand respondents take the opportunity to give us feedback.

## What backgrounds do our users have?

![Bar graph displaying different backgrounds of users](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-survey-primary-background.png)

New users were only able to select a single, primary background. Just over half of respondents had a background as **Software Developers** (53%), while the next largest group were primarily **Students** (14%).

Approximations of remaining background options:

- **Researcher** (7%)
- **Manager** (7%)
- **DevOps** (7%)
- **Technical Writer** (4%)

The **Other** (8%) group was spread across a variety of results. We were able to generalize the respondents into additional groups.

- Systems/Infrastructure/IT/InfoSec Administrators/Engineers (1%)
  - Solutions Architects
  - InfoSec / CyberSecurity
  - Systems Engineers/Administrators
  - etc.
- General Hobbyist/Multipotentialite/Polymath (<1%)
- Data Scientist (<1%)
- Artist (Designer/Musician/etc.) (<1%)
- Author/Writer/Blogger (<1%)
- Teacher/Professor (<1%)

There were some smaller groups that stood out in the **Other** category, having one to three respondents:

- Therapists
- Legal (Lawyers/Law Graduates)
- GeoChemistry 
- Pharmacist
- Biologist
- D&D Player
- Dentist

## What are people using Dendron for?

![Bar graph displaying different uses users have for Dendron](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-survey-purpose-of-dendron.png)

New users were able to select all that applied. A majority of users are coming to Dendron, first and foremost, for a **Personal Knowledge Base** (80%) solution.

Approximations of remaining uses:

- **Todos and Agenda** (57%)
- **Research** (47%)
- **Meeting notes** (45%)
- **Team knowledge base** (29%)
- **Publishing** (22%)

18% of respondents provided additional information under **Other**. Users want to use Dendron for so many things that it was rather difficult to create good categories for them.

> The percentages are in relation to the respondents in **Other**

- Student/Learning/Class/Academia Notes (4%)
- Journaling (4%)
- Content Creation and Non-fiction/Fiction Writing (3%)
- Project / Software Documentation (2%)
- System/Product Configuration and Design (2%)
- CRM (1%)
- Second Brain (1%)
- Gaming Notes (D&D, RPGs, General) (1%)

There were some smaller groups that stood out in the **Other** category, having one to three respondents:

- Scripted/Automated documentation creation
- Tracking, Reading, and Taking Notes on Books
- Recipes / Cookbook
- Drafting GitHub issues/MRs
- Event planning
- Presentations

## Are users coming from any existing tools?

![Bar graph displaying different tools used before or with Dendron](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-survey-previous-tools.png)

New users were able to select all that applied. More users said they were coming from **No Previous Tool** (26%) than users who found themselves looking at Dendron after something else, with **OneNote** (25%) coming in a close second.

Approximations of remaining previous (or parallel) tools:

- **Notion** (23%)
- **Google Keep** (19%)
- **Obsidian** (18%)
- **Evernote** (14%)
- **Roam** (5%)
- **Logseq** (5%)
- **Foam** (5%)

15% of respondents provided additional information under **Other**, providing a total of over **70 different tools and workflows.** Here are the top **Other** tools listed.

> The percentages are in relation to the respondents in **Other**

- Joplin (9%)
- org-mode / org-roam / emacs (6%)
- Bear (6%)
- Apple Notes (4%)
- Plain Markdown or text files (4%)
- Trello / Confluence / Jira (4%)
- Typora (3%)
- Physical notes (2%)

## Do users have plans on publishing their notes?

![Bar graph displaying levels of interest in publishing with Dendron](https://org-dendron-public-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/images/2021-survey-publishing-interest.png)

New users were only able to select a single response, if they were to respond to this question at all. A majority of users were **Curious** (39%) about publishing, or otherwise already saying **Yes** (36%) to planning publishing. The remaining respondents said **No** (25%) and were not interested in Dendron's publishing capabilities.

## Takeaways

Users are drawn to Dendron for Personal Knowledge Management (PKM), task management, research, and more.

With that in mind, Dendron and the Dendron community have been introducing more features and enhancements that continue to develop:

- [Task Notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/SEASewZSteDK7ry1AshNG/)
  - [Contribute to the GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron/discussions/1358)
- [Note Traits](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/EQoaBI8A0ZcswKQC3UMpO/)
- [The Open PKM Catalogue](https://pkm.dendron.so): This work-in-progress is meant to be a reference of all things PKM.
- Improvements to [importing existing Markdown](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f23a6290-2dec-45dc-b616-c218ee53db6b/)
- Better workflows, such as using [multiple vaults with private and public notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/6DZiBObwhZNYRjnokQ422/)

Though half of respondents said they were developers, the other half of new users came from tech and non-tech backgrounds. This includes many users where Dendron is their introduction to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [git, and GitHub](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/vsAxYld4zsbD2XjKoh7OP/).

Here are a few areas where we've taken action:

- [Refreshed Getting Started Guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/)
- GitHub Templates for easier, more automated publishing
  - [Publish with Netlify](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/yetuum6o9wZi6eVJQBbQb/)
  - [Publish with GitHub Pages and GitHub Actions](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/FnK2ws6w1uaS1YzBUY3BR/)
- Improved `Change Workspace` and `Initialize Workspace` UX

Many of our new users are coming to Dendron as their first tool for personal knowledge management than from any other tool. Even then, the amount of different workflows and tooling that people come from (or are using in parallel) is a massive list.

We have a [migration guide](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/f9b4fc21-7613-4c8a-9257-cec4c06b67f9/) that can be referenced for people wanting to import their existing notes into Dendron. With so many tools out there, we are open to [any docs contributions and improvements](https://github.com/dendronhq/dendron-site/blob/master/vault/dendron.guides.migration.md) whenever someone transforms into a dendronite.

Within the Dendron Discord, users have mentioned their interest in _interoperability_: they want a single source that they export/import their notes to/from. Our users do this with pods or their own tooling. Different tools co-exist in workflows and can be used concurrently, which further strengthens our belief [that pods are important](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/66727a39-d0a7-449b-a10d-f6c438185d7f/).

- The Dendron team reflects this. For example, we make use of Airtable every day and will be releasing an Airtable pod in the near future.

Dendron also stands out compared to other static site generator (SSG) tools due to our UX/DX in managing and taking notes. The quarter of respondents expressing no interest in publishing may also reflect the absence of popular SSGs (Sphinx, Hugo, Jekyll, etc.) in response to tools our users are familiar with.

We, ourselves, have had a journey of publishing within the Dendron toolchain. We've gone from [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), to [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), and eventually to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (a story for another time!). Using Dendron's built-in publishing provides the best experience, but users can make use of other SSGs with their favorite themes by [exporting Dendron notes](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/ccab31c4-e9ca-4ee8-b754-f786a3f3be6e/) and tweaking where needed.

## Last words

Again, to all the new users that took our survey: thank you! Without you, we wouldn't have the insight we do into who is trying out Dendron and what features people find most valuable.
